# A\* Pathfinding Visualizer

This project implements an interactive visualizer for the A\* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm using Python and Pygame. It allows users to construct obstacle maps in real time, visualize the search process, and observe the optimal path calculated between two nodes on a grid.

## üîç Features

* **Interactive Grid-Based Interface**
  Click to toggle walls (obstacles) on a 2D grid.

* **Real-Time Visualization**
  Watch the A\* algorithm in action as it expands nodes and finds the optimal path.

* **Diagonal Movement Support**
  Supports both cardinal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal movement with distinct movement costs.

* **Color-Coded Feedback**

  * üü© Green: Visited nodes (explored)
  * üü® Yellow: Final shortest path
  * ‚¨õ Black: Obstacles/walls
  * ‚ö™ Light gray: Unvisited grid cells
